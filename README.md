Gameplay:

  The game has 3 main stages, and each stage has a different level of difficulty.

  The stage is considered complete when all monsters on the map are defeated.
  If the player dies, the stage resets.

Inventory System:

  Inventory UI:
        When you right-click on items on the ground, the character picks up the items and adds them to the inventory.
        From the inventory, items can be equipped.
  Open Inventory:
        Press B or I to open the inventory.
        Click the left mouse button on an item in the inventory to equip it.
  Item Arrangement:
        Items in the inventory are arranged from left to right.
        When equipped, the items are shifted to the left.

        Press U to unequip all currently equipped items and return them to the inventory.
  Deleting Items:
        Click the X icon on an item in the inventory to delete it.
  Interaction Behavior:
        The player can move normally by left-clicking outside the menu area.
        If the player clicks inside the menu area, the character cannot move.

Character Stats:

  The character has its own stats:
        Max health: 100.
        Default damage: 5.
  Equipped Items:
        When equipped, items provide increased armor and reduced damage taken.
        Equipping armor replaces the characterâ€™s default clothes with armor pieces.
        Armor and pants increase armor stats, while weapons (like swords) increase damage output.
        If unequipped, the additional stats disappear, returning the character to its default stats.
  Taking Damage:
        Monsters deal damage to the character.
        When the character approaches a certain range, monsters will chase the character.
        If the character moves far enough away, the monsters will stop chasing.
        When the character takes damage and dies, the stage will reset.

Combat Mechanics:

  There is a cooldown for each attack to prevent spamming.
  Both the player and the monsters have a health bar:
        The health bar decreases from right to left when taking damage.
        The health bar disappears if the character does not take damage for a certain period of time.

Scoring System:

  Points are awarded based on the number of monsters defeated.
  If the player dies during a stage:
        When the stage reloads, all points earned during that stage are lost.
        Additionally, 10 points are deducted as a death penalty.
